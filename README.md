MINST-Dataset-Classification

This is a project that uses TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project provides six different models for classification, including:

1.Shallow neural network model using ADAM optimizer
2.Shallow neural network using SGD minibatch optimizer
3.Shallow neural network model using RMSprop optimizer
4.Deep neural network model using ADAM optimizer
5.Deep neural network model using SGD optimizer
6.Deep neural network model using RMSprop optimizer

Each model has been implemented using a combination of different optimization techniques and hyperparameters to achieve the best possible accuracy for the classification task.

The project also provides detailed instructions on how to download and preprocess the MNIST dataset, as well as how to train and evaluate the models using different metrics. Additionally, the project includes visualizations of the training and testing results using Matplotlib.

If you are interested in exploring different optimization techniques and their impact on the accuracy of image classification tasks, this project is a great starting point.
